<p>John Warner Backus who is one of the most important computer scientists was born on 3 December 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.<a href="#figure1">(Figure 1)</a> He started to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and graduated from there in 1942 even though he did not study hard enough. <a href="#ref1"> <sup>[1]</sup></a> After graduation, he enrolled the University of Virginia to study chemistry upon his father's demand. Nevertheless, he did not willing about studying here, so he left the university in 1943 and attended the U.S. army in this year. </p>
<p>In the army he began taking medical training at the Haverford College <a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and worked in an Atlantic City hospital. After a while he left his medical training undone, because he thinks medical field has not been convenient by himself. Then, Backus moved to New York and started to the Columbia University to study mathematics there. In 1949, he graduated from the university, after a year he joined the IBM as a programmer.<a href="#ref3"> <sup>[3]</sup></a>
</p>
<p> In 1954, Backus created the FORTRAN<a href="#figure2">(Figure 2)</a>, which is the first high level programming language that have particularly numeric and scientific computation <a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, together with his crew. Over the years, FORTRAN became a popular programming language with developed versions (II, III, 77, 2008 etc.), especially fields of science and engineering. Also, there are several studies Backus did like ALGOL, Backus-Naur form and Function level programming <a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, but the best known is FORTRAN.</p>
<p>Finally, John Warner Backus retired from IBM in 1991 and died on 17 March 2007 in Ashland, Oregon.</p>
